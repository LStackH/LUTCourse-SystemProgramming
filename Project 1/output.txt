     if you pardon, we will mend:

     No more yielding but a dream,
     And this weak and idle theme,

     Despised in nativity,
     Nor mark prodigious, such as are
     Never mole, hare lip, nor scar,

     From the presence of the sun,
     By the triple Hecate's team,

     He bravely broach'd is boiling bloody breast;
     Whereat, with blade, with bloody blameful blade,
     And finds his trusty Thisby's mantle slain:
     Anon comes Pyramus, sweet youth and tall,
     Which Lion vile with bloody mouth did stain.
     And, as she fled, her mantle she did fall,
     Did scare away, or rather did affright;
     The trusty Thisby, coming first by night,
     This grisly beast, which Lion hight by name,
     To meet at Ninus' tomb, there, there to woo.
     By moonshine did these lovers think no scorn
     Presenteth Moonshine; for, if you will know,
     This man, with lanthorn, dog, and bush of thorn,
     To whisper. At the which let no man wonder.
     And through Wall's chink, poor souls, they are content

     Masters, the duke is coming from the temple, and

     You must say 'paragon:' a paramour is, God bless us,

   FLUTE

     paramour for a sweet voice.
     Yea and the best person too; and he is a very

   QUINCE

     man in Athens.
     No, he hath simply the best wit of any handicraft

   FLUTE

     Athens able to discharge Pyramus but he.
     It is not possible: you have not a man in all

   QUINCE

     not forward, doth it?
     If he come not, then the play is marred: it goes

   FLUTE

     transported.
     He cannot be heard of. Out of doubt he is

     Have you sent to Bottom's house ? is he come home yet?

     peradventure, to make it the more gracious, I shall
     latter end of a play, before the duke:
     because it hath no bottom; and I will sing it in the
     this dream: it shall be called Bottom's Dream,
     was. I will get Peter Quince to write a ballad of
     to conceive, nor his heart to report, what my dream
     seen, man's hand is not able to taste, his tongue
     of man hath not heard, the ear of man hath not
     he will offer to say what methought I had. The eye
     methought I had,--but man is but a patched fool, if
     is no man can tell what. Methought I was,--and
     about to expound this dream. Methought I was--there
     say what dream it was: man is but an ass, if he go
     vision. I have had a dream, past the wit of man to
     hence, and left me asleep! I have had a most rare
     the tinker! Starveling! God's my life, stolen
     Peter Quince! Flute, the bellows-mender! Snout,
     answer: my next is, 'Most fair Pyramus.' Heigh-ho!
     [Awaking] When my cue comes, call me, and I will

   BOTTOM

     Exeunt

     And by the way let us recount our dreams.
     Why, then, we are awake: let's follow him

   DEMETRIUS

     And he did bid us follow to the temple.

   LYSANDER

     And Hippolyta.

   HELENA

     Yea; and my father.

   HERMIA

     The duke was here, and bid us follow him?
     That yet we sleep, we dream. Do not you think
     That we are awake? It seems to me
     Are you sure

   DEMETRIUS

     Mine own, and not mine own.
     And I have found Demetrius like a jewel,
     So methinks:

   HELENA

     When every thing seems double.
     Methinks I see these things with parted eye,

   HERMIA

     These things seem small and undistinguishable,

   DEMETRIUS

     Exeunt THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and train

     Come, Hippolyta.
     We'll hold a feast in great solemnity.
     Away with us to Athens; three and three,
     Our purposed hunting shall be set aside.
     And, for the morning now is something worn,
     These couples shall eternally be knit:
     For in the temple by and by with us
     Egeus, I will overbear your will;
     Of this discourse we more will hear anon.
     Fair lovers, you are fortunately met:

   THESEUS

     And will for evermore be true to it.
     Now I do wish it, love it, long for it,
     But, as in health, come to my natural taste,
     But, like in sickness, did I loathe this food;
     Was I betroth'd ere I saw Hermia:
     Is only Helena. To her, my lord,
     The object and the pleasure of mine eye,
     And all the faith, the virtue of my heart,
     Which in my childhood I did dote upon;
     As the remembrance of an idle gaud
     Melted as the snow, seems to me now
     But by some power it is,--my love to Hermia,
     But, my good lord, I wot not by what power,--
     Fair Helena in fancy following me.
     And I in fury hither follow'd them,
     Of this their purpose hither to this wood;
     My lord, fair Helen told me of their stealth,

   DEMETRIUS

     Of my consent that she should be your wife.
     You of your wife and me of my consent,
     Thereby to have defeated you and me,
     They would have stolen away; they would, Demetrius,
     I beg the law, the law, upon his head.
     Enough, enough, my lord; you have enough:

   EGEUS

     Without the peril of the Athenian law.
     Was to be gone from Athens, where we might,
     I came with Hermia hither: our intent
     And now do I bethink me, so it is,--
     But, as I think,--for truly would I speak,
     I cannot truly say how I came here;
     Half sleep, half waking: but as yet, I swear,
     My lord, I shall reply amazedly,

   LYSANDER

     To sleep by hate, and fear no enmity?
     That hatred is so far from jealousy,
     How comes this gentle concord in the world,
     I know you two are rival enemies:
     I pray you all, stand up.

   THESEUS

     Pardon, my lord.

   LYSANDER

     Begin these wood-birds but to couple now?
     Good morrow, friends. Saint Valentine is past:
     and start up
     Horns and shout within. LYSANDER, DEMETRIUS, HELENA, and HERMIA wake

     Go, bid the huntsmen wake them with their horns.

   THESEUS

     It is, my lord.

   EGEUS

     That Hermia should give answer of her choice?
     But speak, Egeus; is not this the day
     Came here in grace our solemnity.
     The rite of May, and hearing our intent,
     No doubt they rose up early to observe

   THESEUS

     I wonder of their being here together.
     This Helena, old Nedar's Helena:
     And this, Lysander; this Demetrius is;
     My lord, this is my daughter here asleep;

   EGEUS

     Judge when you hear. But, soft! what nymphs are these?
     In Crete, in Sparta, nor in Thessaly:
     Was never holla'd to, nor cheer'd with horn,
     Each under each. A cry more tuneable
     Slow in pursuit, but match'd in mouth like bells,
     Crook-knee'd, and dew-lapp'd like Thessalian bulls;
     With ears that sweep away the morning dew;
     So flew'd, so sanded, and their heads are hung
     My hounds are bred out of the Spartan kind,

   THESEUS

     So musical a discord, such sweet thunder.
     Seem'd all one mutual cry: I never heard
     The skies, the fountains, every region near
     Such gallant chiding: for, besides the groves,
     With hounds of Sparta: never did I hear
     When in a wood of Crete they bay'd the bear
     I was with Hercules and Cadmus once,

   HIPPOLYTA

     Of hounds and echo in conjunction.
     And mark the musical confusion
     We will, fair queen, up to the mountain's top,
     Exit an Attendant

     Dispatch, I say, and find the forester.
     Uncouple in the western valley; let them go:
     My love shall hear the music of my hounds.
     And since we have the vaward of the day,
     For now our observation is perform'd;
     Go, one of you, find out the forester;

   THESEUS

     Enter THESEUS, HIPPOLYTA, EGEUS, and train

     Horns winded within

     Exeunt

     With these mortals on the ground.
     That I sleeping here was found
     Tell me how it came this night
     Come, my lord, and in our flight

   TITANIA

     Swifter than the wandering moon.
     We the globe can compass soon,
     Trip we after the night's shade:
     Then, my queen, in silence sad,

   OBERON

     I do hear the morning lark.
     Fairy king, attend, and mark:

   PUCK

     Wedded, with Theseus, all in jollity.
     There shall the pairs of faithful lovers be
     And bless it to all fair prosperity:
     Dance in Duke Theseus' house triumphantly,
     And will to-morrow midnight solemnly
     Now thou and I are new in amity,
     And rock the ground whereon these sleepers be.
     Sound, music! Come, my queen, take hands with me,

   OBERON

     own fool's eyes peep.
     Now, when thou wakest, with thine

   PUCK

     Music, still

     Music, ho! music, such as charmeth sleep!

   TITANIA

     Than common sleep of all these five the sense.
     Titania, music call; and strike more dead
     Silence awhile. Robin, take off this head.

   OBERON

     O, how mine eyes do loathe his visage now!
     How came these things to pass?

   TITANIA

     There lies your love.

   OBERON

     Methought I was enamour'd of an ass.
     My Oberon! what visions have I seen!

   TITANIA

     Now, my Titania; wake you, my sweet queen.
     Hath such force and blessed power.
     Dian's bud o'er Cupid's flower
     See as thou wast wont to see:
     Be as thou wast wont to be;
     But first I will release the fairy queen.
     But as the fierce vexation of a dream.
     And think no more of this night's accidents
     May all to Athens back again repair
     That, he awaking when the other do,
     From off the head of this Athenian swain;
     And, gentle Puck, take this transformed scalp
     This hateful imperfection of her eyes:
     And now I have the boy, I will undo
     To bear him to my bower in fairy land.
     Which straight she gave me, and her fairy sent
     I then did ask of her her changeling child;
     And she in mild terms begg'd my patience,
     When I had at my pleasure taunted her
     Like tears that did their own disgrace bewail.
     Stood now within the pretty flowerets' eyes
     Was wont to swell like round and orient pearls,
     And that same dew, which sometime on the buds
     With a coronet of fresh and fragrant flowers;
     For she his hairy temples then had rounded
     I did upbraid her and fall out with her;
     Seeking sweet favours from this hateful fool,
     For, meeting her of late behind the wood,
     Her dotage now I do begin to pity:
     See'st thou this sweet sight?
     [Advancing] Welcome, good Robin.

   OBERON

     Enter PUCK

     They sleep

     O, how I love thee! how I dote on thee!
     Enrings the barky fingers of the elm.
     Gently entwist; the female ivy so
     So doth the woodbine the sweet honeysuckle
     Exeunt fairies

     Fairies, begone, and be all ways away.
     Sleep thou, and I will wind thee in my arms.

   TITANIA

     have an exposition of sleep come upon me.
     But, I pray you, let none of your people stir me: I
     I had rather have a handful or two of dried peas.

   BOTTOM

     The squirrel's hoard, and fetch thee new nuts.
     I have a venturous fairy that shall seek

   TITANIA

     of hay: good hay, sweet hay, hath no fellow.
     dry oats. Methinks I have a great desire to a bottle
     Truly, a peck of provender: I could munch your good

   BOTTOM

     Or say, sweet love, what thou desirest to eat.

   TITANIA

     the tongs and the bones.
     I have a reasonable good ear in music. Let's have

   BOTTOM

     my sweet love?
     What, wilt thou hear some music,

   TITANIA

     I must scratch.
     am such a tender ass, if my hair do but tickle me,
     methinks I am marvellous hairy about the face; and I
     to scratch. I must to the barber's, monsieur; for
     Nothing, good mounsieur, but to help Cavalery Cobweb

   BOTTOM

     What's your Will?

   MUSTARDSEED

     leave your courtesy, good mounsieur.
     Give me your neaf, Mounsieur Mustardseed. Pray you,

   BOTTOM

     Ready.

   MUSTARDSEED

     honey-bag, signior. Where's Mounsieur Mustardseed?
     I would be loath to have you overflown with a
     good mounsieur, have a care the honey-bag break not;
     yourself too much in the action, mounsieur; and,
     mounsieur, bring me the honey-bag. Do not fret
     humble-bee on the top of a thistle; and, good
     weapons in your hand, and kill me a red-hipped
     Mounsieur Cobweb, good mounsieur, get you your

     Ready.

     Scratch my head Peaseblossom. Where's Mounsieur Cobweb?

   BOTTOM

     Ready.

   PEASEBLOSSOM

     Where's Peaseblossom?

   BOTTOM

     And kiss thy fair large ears, my gentle joy.
     And stick musk-roses in thy sleek smooth head,
     While I thy amiable cheeks do coy,
     Come, sit thee down upon this flowery bed,

   TITANIA

     and other Fairies attending; OBERON behind unseen
     Enter TITANIA and BOTTOM; PEASEBLOSSOM, COBWEB, MOTH, MUSTARDSEED,

     lying asleep.

     The man shall have his mare again, and all shall be well.
     Nought shall go ill;
     Jack shall have Jill;
     In your waking shall be shown:
     That every man should take his own,
     And the country proverb known,
     Of thy former lady's eye:

     True delight
     Thou takest

     Squeezing the juice on LYSANDER's eyes

     Gentle lover, remedy.
     To your eye,
     I'll apply
     Sleep sound:
     On the ground

   PUCK

     Lies down and sleeps

     Heavens shield Lysander, if they mean a fray!
     Here will I rest me till the break of day.
     My legs can keep no pace with my desires.
     I can no further crawl, no further go;
     Bedabbled with the dew and torn with briers,
     Never so weary, never so in woe,

   HERMIA

     Re-enter HERMIA

     Thus to make poor females mad.
     Cupid is a knavish lad,
     Here she comes, curst and sad:
     Two of both kinds make up four.
     Yet but three? Come one more;

   PUCK

     Lies down and sleeps

     Steal me awhile from mine own company.
     And sleep, that sometimes shuts up sorrow's eye,
     From these that my poor company detest:
     That I may back to Athens by daylight,
     Abate thy hour! Shine comforts from the east,
     O weary night, O long and tedious night,

   HELENA

     Re-enter HELENA

     Lies down and sleeps

     By day's approach look to be visited.
     To measure out my length on this cold bed.
     Now, go thy way. Faintness constraineth me
     If ever I thy face by daylight see:
     Nay, then, thou mock'st me. Thou shalt buy this dear,

   DEMETRIUS

     Come hither: I am here.

   PUCK

     Where art thou now?
     And darest not stand, nor look me in the face.
     Thou runn'st before me, shifting every place,
     Abide me, if thou darest; for well I wot

   DEMETRIUS

     Ho, ho, ho! Coward, why comest thou not?

   PUCK

     Re-enter PUCK and DEMETRIUS

     Sleeps

     I'll find Demetrius and revenge this spite.
     For if but once thou show me thy grey light,
     Come, thou gentle day!
     Lies down

     And here will rest me.
     That fallen am I in dark uneven way,
     I follow'd fast, but faster he did fly;
     The villain is much lighter-heel'd than I:
     When I come where he calls, then he is gone.
     He goes before me and still dares me on:

   LYSANDER

     Re-enter LYSANDER

     Exeunt

     Follow my voice: we'll try no manhood here.

   PUCK

     Yea, art thou there?

   DEMETRIUS

     That draws a sword on thee.
     I'll whip thee with a rod: he is defiled
     And wilt not come? Come, recreant; come, thou child;
     Telling the bushes that thou look'st for wars,
     Thou coward, art thou bragging to the stars,

   PUCK

     Speak! In some bush? Where dost thou hide thy head?
     Thou runaway, thou coward, art thou fled?
     Lysander! speak again:

   DEMETRIUS

     Re-enter DEMETRIUS

     Exit LYSANDER, as following the voice

     To plainer ground.
     Follow me, then,

   PUCK

     I will be with thee straight.

   LYSANDER

     Here, villain; drawn and ready. Where art thou?

   PUCK

     Where art thou, proud Demetrius? speak thou now.

   LYSANDER

     Re-enter LYSANDER

     Here comes one.
     Goblin, lead them up and down.
     I am fear'd in field and town:
     I will lead them up and down:
     Up and down, up and down,

   PUCK

     Exit

     We may effect this business yet ere day.
     But, notwithstanding, haste; make no delay:
     Turns into yellow gold his salt green streams.
     Opening on Neptune with fair blessed beams,
     Even till the eastern gate, all fiery-red,
     And, like a forester, the groves may tread,
     I with the morning's love have oft made sport,
     But we are spirits of another sort:

   OBERON

     And must for aye consort with black-brow'd night.
     They willfully themselves exile from light
     For fear lest day should look their shames upon,
     Already to their wormy beds are gone;
     That in crossways and floods have burial,
     Troop home to churchyards: damned spirits all,
     At whose approach, ghosts, wandering here and there,
     And yonder shines Aurora's harbinger;
     For night's swift dragons cut the clouds full fast,
     My fairy lord, this must be done with haste,

   PUCK

     From monster's view, and all things shall be peace.
     And then I will her charmed eye release
     I'll to my queen and beg her Indian boy;
     Whiles I in this affair do thee employ,
     With league whose date till death shall never end.
     And back to Athens shall the lovers wend,
     Shall seem a dream and fruitless vision,
     When they next wake, all this derision
     And make his eyeballs roll with wonted sight.
     To take from thence all error with his might,
     Whose liquor hath this virtuous property,
     Then crush this herb into Lysander's eye;
     With leaden legs and batty wings doth creep:
     Till o'er their brows death-counterfeiting sleep
     And from each other look thou lead them thus,
     And sometime rail thou like Demetrius;
     Then stir Demetrius up with bitter wrong;
     Like to Lysander sometime frame thy tongue,
     As one come not within another's way.
     And lead these testy rivals so astray
     With drooping fog as black as Acheron,
     The starry welkin cover thou anon
     Hie therefore, Robin, overcast the night;
     Thou see'st these lovers seek a place to fight:

   OBERON

     As this their jangling I esteem a sport.
     And so far am I glad it so did sort
     That I have 'nointed an Athenian's eyes;
     And so far blameless proves my enterprise,
     By the Athenian garment be had on?
     Did not you tell me I should know the man
     Believe me, king of shadows, I mistook.

   PUCK

     Or else committ'st thy knaveries wilfully.
     This is thy negligence: still thou mistakest,

   OBERON

     Exit

     I am amazed, and know not what to say.

   HERMIA

     Exit

     My legs are longer though, to run away.
     Your hands than mine are quicker for a fray,
     Nor longer stay in your curst company.
     I will not trust you, I,

   HELENA

     Nay, go not back.
     You, mistress, all this coil is 'long of you:

   HERMIA

     Exeunt LYSANDER and DEMETRIUS

     Follow! nay, I'll go with thee, cheek by jole.

   DEMETRIUS

     Of thine or mine, is most in Helena.
     Now follow, if thou darest, to try whose right,
     Now she holds me not;

   LYSANDER

     Thou shalt aby it.
     Never so little show of love to her,
     Take not her part; for, if thou dost intend
     Let her alone: speak not of Helena;
     In her behalf that scorns your services.
     You are too officious

   DEMETRIUS

     You bead, you acorn.
     You minimus, of hindering knot-grass made;
     Get you gone, you dwarf;

   LYSANDER

     Let me come to her.
     Why will you suffer her to flout me thus?
     'Little' again! nothing but 'low' and 'little'!

   HERMIA

     And though she be but little, she is fierce.
     She was a vixen when she went to school;
     O, when she's angry, she is keen and shrewd!

   HELENA

     No, sir, she shall not, though you take her part.

   DEMETRIUS

     Be not afraid; she shall not harm thee, Helena.

   LYSANDER

     With Demetrius.

   HELENA

     What, with Lysander?

   HERMIA

     A foolish heart, that I leave here behind.

   HELENA

     Why, get you gone: who is't that hinders you?

   HERMIA

     You see how simple and how fond I am.
     And follow you no further: let me go:
     To Athens will I bear my folly back
     And now, so you will let me quiet go,
     To strike me, spurn me, nay, to kill me too:
     But he hath chid me hence and threaten'd me
     He follow'd you; for love I follow'd him;
     I told him of your stealth unto this wood.
     Save that, in love unto Demetrius,
     Did ever keep your counsels, never wrong'd you;
     I evermore did love you, Hermia,
     Good Hermia, do not be so bitter with me.

   HELENA

     Lower! hark, again.

   HERMIA

     That I can match her.
     Because she is something lower than myself,
     Let her not strike me. You perhaps may think,
     I am a right maid for my cowardice:
     I have no gift at all in shrewishness;
     Let her not hurt me: I was never curst;
     I pray you, though you mock me, gentlemen,

   HELENA

     But that my nails can reach unto thine eyes.
     How low am I? I am not yet so low
     How low am I, thou painted maypole? speak;
     Because I am so dwarfish and so low?
     And are you grown so high in his esteem;
     Her height, forsooth, she hath prevail'd with him.
     And with her personage, her tall personage,
     Between our statures; she hath urged her height;
     Now I perceive that she hath made compare
     Puppet? why so? ay, that way goes the game.

   HERMIA

     Fie, fie! you counterfeit, you puppet, you!
     Impatient answers from my gentle tongue?
     No touch of bashfulness? What, will you tear
     Have you no modesty, no maiden shame,
     Fine, i'faith!

   HELENA

     And stolen my love's heart from him?
     You thief of love! what, have you come by night
     O me! you juggler! you canker-blossom!

   HERMIA

     That I do hate thee and love Helena.
     Be certain, nothing truer; 'tis no jest
     Therefore be out of hope, of question, of doubt;
     And never did desire to see thee more.
     Ay, by my life;

   LYSANDER

     In earnest, shall I say?
     Why, then you left me--O, the gods forbid!--
     me:
     Since night you loved me; yet since night you left
     I am as fair now as I was erewhile.
     Am not I Hermia? are not you Lysander?
     Hate me! wherefore? O me! what news, my love!
     What, can you do me greater harm than hate?

   HERMIA

     Although I hate her, I'll not harm her so.
     What, should I hurt her, strike her, kill her dead?

   LYSANDER

     A weak bond holds you: I'll not trust your word.
     I would I had your bond, for I perceive

   DEMETRIUS

     Demetrius, I will keep my word with thee.

   LYSANDER

     Yes, sooth; and so do you.

   HELENA

     Do you not jest?

   HERMIA

     Out, loathed medicine! hated potion, hence!
     Thy love! out, tawny Tartar, out!

   LYSANDER

     Sweet love,--
     Why are you grown so rude? what change is this?

   HERMIA

     Or I will shake thee from me like a serpent!
     Hang off, thou cat, thou burr! vile thing, let loose,

   LYSANDER

     But yet come not: you are a tame man, go!
     Seem to break loose; take on as you would follow,
     No, no; he'll [ ]

   DEMETRIUS

     Away, you Ethiope!

   LYSANDER

     Lysander, whereto tends all this?

   HERMIA

     Quick, come!

   DEMETRIUS

     If thou say so, withdraw, and prove it too.

   LYSANDER

     I say I love thee more than he can do.

   DEMETRIUS

     To prove him false that says I love thee not.
     I swear by that which I will lose for thee,
     Helen, I love thee; by my life, I do:
     Thy threats have no more strength than her weak prayers.
     Thou canst compel no more than she entreat:

   LYSANDER

     If she cannot entreat, I can compel.

   DEMETRIUS

     Sweet, do not scorn her so.

   HERMIA

     O excellent!

   HELENA

     My love, my life my soul, fair Helena!
     Stay, gentle Helena; hear my excuse:

   LYSANDER

     Which death or absence soon shall remedy.
     But fare ye well: 'tis partly my own fault;
     You would not make me such an argument.
     If you have any pity, grace, or manners,
     This sport, well carried, shall be chronicled.
     Wink each at other; hold the sweet jest up:
     Make mouths upon me when I turn my back;
     Ay, do, persever, counterfeit sad looks,

   HELENA

     I understand not what you mean by this.

   HERNIA

     This you should pity rather than despise.
     But miserable most, to love unloved?
     So hung upon with love, so fortunate,
     What thought I be not so in grace as you,
     But by your setting on, by your consent?
     And tender me, forsooth, affection,
     Deny your love, so rich within his soul,
     To her he hates? and wherefore doth Lysander
     Precious, celestial? Wherefore speaks he this
     To call me goddess, nymph, divine and rare,
     Who even but now did spurn me with his foot,
     And made your other love, Demetrius,
     To follow me and praise my eyes and face?
     Have you not set Lysander, as in scorn,

   HELENA

     I scorn you not: it seems that you scorn me.
     I am amazed at your passionate words.

   HERMIA

     Though I alone do feel the injury.
     Our sex, as well as I, may chide you for it,
     It is not friendly, 'tis not maidenly:
     To join with men in scorning your poor friend?
     And will you rent our ancient love asunder,
     Due but to one and crowned with one crest.
     Two of the first, like coats in heraldry,
     So, with two seeming bodies, but one heart;
     Two lovely berries moulded on one stem;
     But yet an union in partition;
     Like to a double cherry, seeming parted,
     Had been incorporate. So we grow together,
     As if our hands, our sides, voices and minds,
     Both warbling of one song, both in one key,
     Both on one sampler, sitting on one cushion,
     Have with our needles created both one flower,
     We, Hermia, like two artificial gods,
     All school-days' friendship, childhood innocence?
     For parting us,--O, is it all forgot?
     When we have chid the hasty-footed time
     The sisters' vows, the hours that we have spent,
     Is all the counsel that we two have shared,
     To bait me with this foul derision?
     Have you conspired, have you with these contrived
     Injurious Hermia! most ungrateful maid!
     To fashion this false sport, in spite of me.
     Now I perceive they have conjoin'd all three
     Lo, she is one of this confederacy!

   HELENA

     You speak not as you think: it cannot be.

   HERMIA

     The hate I bear thee made me leave thee so?
     Why seek'st thou me? could not this make thee know,
     Than all you fiery oes and eyes of light.
     Fair Helena, who more engilds the night
     Lysander's love, that would not let him bide,

   LYSANDER

     What love could press Lysander from my side?

   HERMIA

     Why should he stay, whom love doth press to go?

   LYSANDER

     But why unkindly didst thou leave me so?
     Mine ear, I thank it, brought me to thy sound
     Thou art not by mine eye, Lysander, found;
     It pays the hearing double recompense.
     Wherein it doth impair the seeing sense,
     The ear more quick of apprehension makes;
     Dark night, that from the eye his function takes,

   HERMIA

     Re-enter HERMIA

     Look, where thy love comes; yonder is thy dear.
     Lest, to thy peril, thou aby it dear.
     Disparage not the faith thou dost not know,

   DEMETRIUS

     Helen, it is not so.

   LYSANDER

     There to remain.
     And now to Helen is it home return'd,
     My heart to her but as guest-wise sojourn'd,
     If e'er I loved her, all that love is gone.
     Lysander, keep thy Hermia; I will none:

   DEMETRIUS

     Never did mockers waste more idle breath.

   HELENA

     Whom I do love and will do till my death.
     And yours of Helena to me bequeath,
     In Hermia's love I yield you up my part;
     And here, with all good will, with all my heart,
     For you love Hermia; this you know I know:
     You are unkind, Demetrius; be not so;

   LYSANDER

     A poor soul's patience, all to make you sport.
     Would so offend a virgin, and extort
     With your derision! none of noble sort
     To conjure tears up in a poor maid's eyes
     A trim exploit, a manly enterprise,
     And now both rivals, to mock Helena:
     You both are rivals, and love Hermia;
     When I am sure you hate me with your hearts.
     To vow, and swear, and superpraise my parts,
     You would not use a gentle lady so;
     If you were men, as men you are in show,
     But you must join in souls to mock me too?
     Can you not hate me, as I know you do,
     You would not do me thus much injury.
     If you we re civil and knew courtesy,
     To set against me for your merriment:
     O spite! O hell! I see you all are bent

   HELENA

     This princess of pure white, this seal of bliss!
     When thou hold'st up thy hand: O, let me kiss
     Fann'd with the eastern wind, turns to a crow
     That pure congealed white, high Taurus snow,
     Thy lips, those kissing cherries, tempting grow!
     Crystal is muddy. O, how ripe in show
     To what, my love, shall I compare thine eyne?
     [Awaking] O Helena, goddess, nymph, perfect, divine!

   DEMETRIUS

     Demetrius loves her, and he loves not you.

   LYSANDER

     Nor none, in my mind, now you give her o'er.

   HELENA

     I had no judgment when to her I swore.

   LYSANDER

     Will even weigh, and both as light as tales.
     Your vows to her and me, put in two scales,
     Weigh oath with oath, and you will nothing weigh:
     These vows are Hermia's: will you give her o'er?
     When truth kills truth, O devilish-holy fray!
     You do advance your cunning more and more.

   HELENA

     Bearing the badge of faith, to prove them true?
     How can these things in me seem scorn to you,
     In their nativity all truth appears.
     Look, when I vow, I weep; and vows so born,
     Scorn and derision never come in tears:
     Why should you think that I should woo in scorn?

   LYSANDER

     Enter LYSANDER and HELENA

     That befal preposterously.
     And those things do best please me
     That must needs be sport alone;
     Then will two at once woo one;

   PUCK

     Will cause Demetrius to awake.
     Stand aside: the noise they make

   OBERON

     Lord, what fools these mortals be!
     Shall we their fond pageant see?
     Pleading for a lover's fee.
     And the youth, mistook by me,
     Helena is here at hand;
     Captain of our fairy band,

   PUCK

     Re-enter PUCK

     Beg of her for remedy.
     When thou wakest, if she be by,
     As the Venus of the sky.
     Let her shine as gloriously
     When his love he doth espy,
     Sink in apple of his eye.
     Hit with Cupid's archery,
     Flower of this purple dye,

   OBERON

     Exit

     Swifter than arrow from the Tartar's bow.
     I go, I go; look how I go,

   PUCK

     I'll charm his eyes against she do appear.
     By some illusion see thou bring her here:
     With sighs of love, that costs the fresh blood dear:
     All fancy-sick she is and pale of cheer,
     And Helena of Athens look thou find:
     About the wood go swifter than the wind,

   OBERON

     A million fail, confounding oath on oath.
     Then fate o'er-rules, that, one man holding troth,

   PUCK

     Some true love turn'd and not a false turn'd true.
     Of thy misprision must perforce ensue
     And laid the love-juice on some true-love's sight:
     What hast thou done? thou hast mistaken quite

   OBERON

     Lies down and sleeps

     If for his tender here I make some stay.
     Which now in some slight measure it will pay,
     For debt that bankrupt sleep doth sorrow owe:
     So sorrow's heaviness doth heavier grow
     Here therefore for a while I will remain.
     There is no following her in this fierce vein:

   DEMETRIUS

     Exit

     See me no more, whether he be dead or no.
     And from thy hated presence part I so:
     A privilege never to see me more.

   HERMIA

     An if I could, what should I get therefore?

   DEMETRIUS

     I pray thee, tell me then that he is well.

   HERMIA

     Nor is he dead, for aught that I can tell.
     I am not guilty of Lysander's blood;
     You spend your passion on a misprised mood:

   DEMETRIUS

     Than thine, thou serpent, never adder stung.
     An adder did it; for with doubler tongue
     Could not a worm, an adder, do so much?
     And hast thou kill'd him sleeping? O brave touch!
     Durst thou have look'd upon him being awake,
     O, once tell true, tell true, even for my sake!
     Henceforth be never number'd among men!
     Of maiden's patience. Hast thou slain him, then?
     Out, dog! out, cur! thou drivest me past the bounds

   HERMIA

     I had rather give his carcass to my hounds.

   DEMETRIUS

     Ah, good Demetrius, wilt thou give him me?
     What's this to my Lysander? where is he?

   HERMIA

     As yonder Venus in her glimmering sphere.
     Yet you, the murderer, look as bright, as clear,
     Pierced through the heart with your stern cruelty:
     So should the murder'd look, and so should I,

   DEMETRIUS

     So should a murderer look, so dead, so grim.
     It cannot be but thou hast murder'd him;
     Her brother's noontide with Antipodes.
     May through the centre creep and so displease
     This whole earth may be bored and that the moon
     From sleeping Hermia? I'll believe as soon
     As he to me: would he have stolen away
     The sun was not so true unto the day
     And kill me too.
     Being o'er shoes in blood, plunge in the deep,
     If thou hast slain Lysander in his sleep,
     For thou, I fear, hast given me cause to curse,
     Now I but chide; but I should use thee worse,

   HERMIA

     Lay breath so bitter on your bitter foe.
     O, why rebuke you him that loves you so?

   DEMETRIUS

     This is the woman, but not this the man.

   PUCK

     Stand close: this is the same Athenian.

   OBERON

     Enter HERMIA and DEMETRIUS

     That, when he waked, of force she must be eyed.
     And the Athenian woman by his side:
     I took him sleeping,--that is finish'd too,--

   PUCK

     With the love-juice, as I did bid thee do?
     But hast thou yet latch'd the Athenian's eyes
     This falls out better than I could devise.

   OBERON

     Titania waked and straightway loved an ass.
     When in that moment, so it came to pass,
     And left sweet Pyramus translated there:
     I led them on in this distracted fear,
     things catch.
     Some sleeves, some hats, from yielders all
     For briers and thorns at their apparel snatch;
     Made senseless things begin to do them wrong;
     thus strong,
     Their sense thus weak, lost with their fears
     He murder cries and help from Athens calls.
     And, at our stamp, here o'er and o'er one falls;
     So, at his sight, away his fellows fly;
     Sever themselves and madly sweep the sky,
     Rising and cawing at the gun's report,
     Or russet-pated choughs, many in sort,
     As wild geese that the creeping fowler eye,
     And forth my mimic comes. When they him spy,
     Anon his Thisbe must be answered,
     An ass's nole I fixed on his head:
     When I did him at this advantage take,
     Forsook his scene and enter'd in a brake
     Who Pyramus presented, in their sport
     The shallowest thick-skin of that barren sort,
     Intended for great Theseus' nuptial-day.
     Were met together to rehearse a play
     That work for bread upon Athenian stalls,
     A crew of patches, rude mechanicals,
     While she was in her dull and sleeping hour,
     Near to her close and consecrated bower,
     My mistress with a monster is in love.

   PUCK

     What night-rule now about this haunted grove?
     How now, mad spirit!
     Here comes my messenger.
     Enter PUCK

     Which she must dote on in extremity.
     Then, what it was that next came in her eye,
     I wonder if Titania be awaked;

   OBERON

     Tie up my love's tongue bring him silently.
     Lamenting some enforced chastity.
     And when she weeps, weeps every little flower,
     The moon methinks looks with a watery eye;
     Come, wait upon him; lead him to my bower.

     To have my love to bed and to arise;
     And light them at the fiery glow-worm's eyes,
     And for night-tapers crop their waxen thighs
     The honey-bags steal from the humble-bees,
     With purple grapes, green figs, and mulberries;

  SCENE I. The wood. TITANIA lying asleep.

  ACT III

     Exit

     Either death or you I'll find immediately.
     No? then I well perceive you all not nigh
     Speak, of all loves! I swoon almost with fear.
     Alack, where are you speak, an if you hear;
     What, out of hearing? gone? no sound, no word?
     Lysander! what, removed? Lysander! lord!
     And you sat smiling at his cruel pray.
     Methought a serpent eat my heart away,
     Lysander, look how I do quake with fear:
     Ay me, for pity! what a dream was here!
     To pluck this crawling serpent from my breast!
     [Awaking] Help me, Lysander, help me! do thy best

   HERMIA

     Exit

     To honour Helen and to be her knight!
     And, all my powers, address your love and might
     Of all be hated, but the most of me!
     So thou, my surfeit and my heresy,
     Are hated most of those they did deceive,
     Or as tie heresies that men do leave
     The deepest loathing to the stomach brings,
     For as a surfeit of the sweetest things
     And never mayst thou come Lysander near!
     She sees not Hermia. Hermia, sleep thou there:

   LYSANDER

     Exit

     Should of another therefore be abused!
     O, that a lady, of one man refused.
     I thought you lord of more true gentleness.
     But fare you well: perforce I must confess
     In such disdainful manner me to woo.
     Good troth, you do me wrong, good sooth, you do,
     But you must flout my insufficiency?
     Deserve a sweet look from Demetrius' eye,
     That I did never, no, nor never can,
     Is't not enough, is't not enough, young man,
     When at your hands did I deserve this scorn?
     Wherefore was I to this keen mockery born?

   HELENA

     Love's stories written in love's richest book.
     And leads me to your eyes, where I o'erlook
     Reason becomes the marshal to my will
     And touching now the point of human skill,
     So I, being young, till now ripe not to reason;
     Things growing are not ripe until their season
     And reason says you are the worthier maid.
     The will of man is by his reason sway'd;
     Who will not change a raven for a dove?
     Not Hermia but Helena I love:
     The tedious minutes I with her have spent.
     Content with Hermia! No; I do repent

   LYSANDER

     Yet Hermia still loves you: then be content.
     What though he love your Hermia? Lord, what though?
     Do not say so, Lysander; say not so

   HELENA

     Is that vile name to perish on my sword!
     Where is Demetrius? O, how fit a word
     That through thy bosom makes me see thy heart.
     Transparent Helena! Nature shows art,
     [Awaking] And run through fire I will for thy sweet sake.

   LYSANDER

     Lysander if you live, good sir, awake.
     Dead? or asleep? I see no blood, no wound.
     But who is here? Lysander! on the ground!
     Made me compare with Hermia's sphery eyne?
     What wicked and dissembling glass of mine
     Do, as a monster fly my presence thus.
     Therefore no marvel though Demetrius
     For beasts that meet me run away for fear:
     No, no, I am as ugly as a bear;
     If so, my eyes are oftener wash'd than hers.
     How came her eyes so bright? Not with salt tears:
     For she hath blessed and attractive eyes.
     Happy is Hermia, wheresoe'er she lies;
     The more my prayer, the lesser is my grace.
     O, I am out of breath in this fond chase!

   HELENA

     Exit

     Stay, on thy peril: I alone will go.

   DEMETRIUS

     O, wilt thou darkling leave me? do not so.

   HELENA

     I charge thee, hence, and do not haunt me thus.

   DEMETRIUS

     Stay, though thou kill me, sweet Demetrius.

   HELENA

     Enter DEMETRIUS and HELENA, running

     Exit

     For I must now to Oberon.
     So awake when I am gone;
     Sleep his seat on thy eyelid:
     When thou wakest, let love forbid
     All the power this charm doth owe.
     Churl, upon thy eyes I throw
     Near this lack-love, this kill-courtesy.
     Pretty soul! she durst not lie
     On the dank and dirty ground.
     And here the maiden, sleeping sound,
     Despised the Athenian maid;
     This is he, my master said,
     Weeds of Athens he doth wear:
     Night and silence.--Who is here?
     This flower's force in stirring love.
     On whose eyes I might approve
     But Athenian found I none,
     Through the forest have I gone.

   PUCK

     Enter PUCK

     They sleep

     With half that wish the wisher's eyes be press'd!

   HERMIA

     Here is my bed: sleep give thee all his rest!
     And then end life when I end loyalty!
     Amen, amen, to that fair prayer, say I;

   LYSANDER

     Thy love ne'er alter till thy sweet life end!
     So far be distant; and, good night, sweet friend:
     Becomes a virtuous bachelor and a maid,
     Such separation as may well be said
     Lie further off; in human modesty,
     But, gentle friend, for love and courtesy
     If Hermia meant to say Lysander lied.
     Now much beshrew my manners and my pride,
     Lysander riddles very prettily:

   HERMIA

     For lying so, Hermia, I do not lie.
     Then by your side no bed-room me deny;
     So then two bosoms and a single troth.
     Two bosoms interchained with an oath;
     So that but one heart we can make of it;
     I mean, that my heart unto yours is knit
     Love takes the meaning in love's conference.
     O, take the sense, sweet, of my innocence!

   LYSANDER

     Lie further off yet, do not lie so near.
     Nay, good Lysander; for my sake, my dear,

   HERMIA

     One heart, one bed, two bosoms and one troth.
     One turf shall serve as pillow for us both;

   LYSANDER

     For I upon this bank will rest my head.
     Be it so, Lysander: find you out a bed;

   HERMIA

     And tarry for the comfort of the day.
     We'll rest us, Hermia, if you think it good,
     And to speak troth, I have forgot our way:
     Fair love, you faint with wandering in the wood;

   LYSANDER

     Enter LYSANDER and HERMIA

     Exit

     Wake when some vile thing is near.
     When thou wakest, it is thy dear:
     In thy eye that shall appear
     Pard, or boar with bristled hair,
     Be it ounce, or cat, or bear,
     Love and languish for his sake:
     Do it for thy true-love take,
     What thou seest when thou dost wake,

   OBERON

     Enter OBERON and squeezes the flower on TITANIA's eyelids

     Exeunt Fairies. TITANIA sleeps

     One aloof stand sentinel.
     Hence, away! now all is well:

   Fairy

     Philomel, with melody, & c.
     Worm nor snail, do no offence.
     Beetles black, approach not near;
     Hence, you long-legg'd spinners, hence!
     Weaving spiders, come not here;
     So, good night, with lullaby.
     Come our lovely lady nigh;
     Nor spell nor charm,
     Never harm,
     Lulla, lulla, lullaby, lulla, lulla, lullaby:
     Sing in our sweet lullaby;
     Philomel, with melody
     Come not near our fairy queen.
     Newts and blind-worms, do no wrong,
     Thorny hedgehogs, be not seen;
     You spotted snakes with double tongue,
     The Fairies sing

     Then to your offices and let me rest.
     At our quaint spirits. Sing me now asleep;
     The clamorous owl that nightly hoots and wonders
     To make my small elves coats, and some keep back
     Some war with rere-mice for their leathern wings,
     Some to kill cankers in the musk-rose buds,
     Then, for the third part of a minute, hence;
     Come, now a roundel and a fairy song;

   TITANIA

     Enter TITANIA, with her train

  SCENE II. Another part of the wood.

     Exeunt

     Fear not, my lord, your servant shall do so.

   PUCK

     And look thou meet me ere the first cock crow.
     More fond on her than she upon her love:
     Effect it with some care, that he may prove
     By the Athenian garments he hath on.
     May be the lady: thou shalt know the man
     But do it when the next thing he espies
     With a disdainful youth: anoint his eyes;
     A sweet Athenian lady is in love
     Take thou some of it, and seek through this grove:
     And make her full of hateful fantasies.
     And with the juice of this I'll streak her eyes,
     Weed wide enough to wrap a fairy in:
     And there the snake throws her enamell'd skin,
     Lull'd in these flowers with dances and delight;
     There sleeps Titania sometime of the night,
     With sweet musk-roses and with eglantine:
     Quite over-canopied with luscious woodbine,
     Where oxlips and the nodding violet grows,
     I know a bank where the wild thyme blows,
     I pray thee, give it me.

   OBERON

     Ay, there it is.

   PUCK

     Hast thou the flower there? Welcome, wanderer.
     Re-enter PUCK

     Thou shalt fly him and he shall seek thy love.
     Fare thee well, nymph: ere he do leave this grove,

   OBERON

     Exit

     To die upon the hand I love so well.
     I'll follow thee and make a heaven of hell,
     Exit DEMETRIUS

     We should be wood and were not made to woo.
     We cannot fight for love, as men may do;
     Your wrongs do set a scandal on my sex:
     You do me mischief. Fie, Demetrius!
     Ay, in the temple, in the town, the field,

   HELENA

     But I shall do thee mischief in the wood.
     Or, if thou follow me, do not believe
     I will not stay thy questions; let me go:

   DEMETRIUS

     When cowardice pursues and valour flies.
     Makes speed to catch the tiger; bootless speed,
     The dove pursues the griffin; the mild hind
     Apollo flies, and Daphne holds the chase;
     Run when you will, the story shall be changed:
     The wildest hath not such a heart as you.

   HELENA

     And leave thee to the mercy of wild beasts.
     I'll run from thee and hide me in the brakes,

   DEMETRIUS

     When all the world is here to look on me?
     Then how can it be said I am alone,
     For you in my respect are all the world:
     Nor doth this wood lack worlds of company,
     Therefore I think I am not in the night;
     It is not night when I do see your face,
     Your virtue is my privilege: for that

   HELENA

     With the rich worth of your virginity.
     And the ill counsel of a desert place
     To trust the opportunity of night
     Into the hands of one that loves you not;
     To leave the city and commit yourself
     You do impeach your modesty too much,

   DEMETRIUS

     And I am sick when I look not on you.

   HELENA

     For I am sick when I do look on thee.
     Tempt not too much the hatred of my spirit;

   DEMETRIUS

     Than to be used as you use your dog?
     And yet a place of high respect with me,--
     What worser place can I beg in your love,--
     Unworthy as I am, to follow you.
     Neglect me, lose me; only give me leave,
     Use me but as your spaniel, spurn me, strike me,
     The more you beat me, I will fawn on you:
     I am your spaniel; and, Demetrius,
     And even for that do I love you the more.

   HELENA

     Tell you, I do not, nor I cannot love you?
     Or, rather, do I not in plainest truth
     Do I entice you? do I speak you fair?

   DEMETRIUS

     And I shall have no power to follow you.
     Is true as steel: leave you your power to draw,
     But yet you draw not iron, for my heart
     You draw me, you hard-hearted adamant;

   HELENA

     Hence, get thee gone, and follow me no more.
     Because I cannot meet my Hermia.
     And here am I, and wode within this wood,
     Thou told'st me they were stolen unto this wood;
     The one I'll slay, the other slayeth me.
     Where is Lysander and fair Hermia?
     I love thee not, therefore pursue me not.

   DEMETRIUS

     Enter DEMETRIUS, HELENA, following him

     And I will overhear their conference.
     But who comes here? I am invisible;
     I'll make her render up her page to me.
     As I can take it with another herb,
     And ere I take this charm from off her sight,
     She shall pursue it with the soul of love:
     On meddling monkey, or on busy ape,
     Be it on lion, bear, or wolf, or bull,
     The next thing then she waking looks upon,
     And drop the liquor of it in her eyes.
     I'll watch Titania when she is asleep,
     Having once this juice,

   OBERON

     Exit

     In forty minutes.
     I'll put a girdle round about the earth

   PUCK

     Ere the leviathan can swim a league.
     Fetch me this herb; and be thou here again
     Upon the next live creature that it sees.
     Will make or man or woman madly dote
     The juice of it on sleeping eye-lids laid
     Fetch me that flower; the herb I shew'd thee once:
     And maidens call it love-in-idleness.
     Before milk-white, now purple with love's wound,
     It fell upon a little western flower,
     Yet mark'd I where the bolt of Cupid fell:
     In maiden meditation, fancy-free.
     And the imperial votaress passed on,
     Quench'd in the chaste beams of the watery moon,
     But I might see young Cupid's fiery shaft
     As it should pierce a hundred thousand hearts;
     And loosed his love-shaft smartly from his bow,
     At a fair vestal throned by the west,
     Cupid all arm'd: a certain aim he took
     Flying between the cold moon and the earth,
     That very time I saw, but thou couldst not,

   OBERON

     I remember.

   PUCK

     To hear the sea-maid's music.
     And certain stars shot madly from their spheres,
     That the rude sea grew civil at her song
     Uttering such dulcet and harmonious breath
     And heard a mermaid on a dolphin's back
     Since once I sat upon a promontory,
     My gentle Puck, come hither. Thou rememberest
     Till I torment thee for this injury.
     Well, go thy way: thou shalt not from this grove

   OBERON

     Exit TITANIA with her train

     We shall chide downright, if I longer stay.
     Not for thy fairy kingdom. Fairies, away!

   TITANIA

     Give me that boy, and I will go with thee.

   OBERON

     If not, shun me, and I will spare your haunts.
     And see our moonlight revels, go with us;
     If you will patiently dance in our round
     Perchance till after Theseus' wedding-day.

   TITANIA

     How long within this wood intend you stay?

   OBERON

     And for her sake I will not part with him.
     And for her sake do I rear up her boy,
     But she, being mortal, of that boy did die;
     As from a voyage, rich with merchandise.
     To fetch me trifles, and return again,
     Would imitate, and sail upon the land,
     Following,--her womb then rich with my young squire,--
     Which she, with pretty and with swimming gait
     And grow big-bellied with the wanton wind;
     When we have laugh'd to see the sails conceive
     Marking the embarked traders on the flood,
     And sat with me on Neptune's yellow sands,
     Full often hath she gossip'd by my side,
     And, in the spiced Indian air, by night,
     His mother was a votaress of my order:
     The fairy land buys not the child of me.
     Set your heart at rest:

   TITANIA

     To be my henchman.
     I do but beg a little changeling boy,
     Why should Titania cross her Oberon?
     Do you amend it then; it lies in you:

   OBERON

     We are their parents and original.
     From our debate, from our dissension;
     And this same progeny of evils comes
     By their increase, now knows not which is which:
     Their wonted liveries, and the mazed world,
     The childing autumn, angry winter, change
     Is, as in mockery, set: the spring, the summer,
     An odorous chaplet of sweet summer buds
     And on old Hiems' thin and icy crown
     Far in the fresh lap of the crimson rose,
     The seasons alter: hoary-headed frosts
     And thorough this distemperature we see
     That rheumatic diseases do abound:
     Pale in her anger, washes all the air,
     Therefore the moon, the governess of floods,
     No night is now with hymn or carol blest:
     The human mortals want their winter here;
     For lack of tread are undistinguishable:
     And the quaint mazes in the wanton green
     The nine men's morris is fill'd up with mud,
     And crows are fatted with the murrion flock;
     The fold stands empty in the drowned field,
     Hath rotted ere his youth attain'd a beard;
     The ploughman lost his sweat, and the green corn
     The ox hath therefore stretch'd his yoke in vain,
     That they have overborne their continents:
     Have every pelting river made so proud
     Contagious fogs; which falling in the land
     As in revenge, have suck'd up from the sea
     Therefore the winds, piping to us in vain,
     But with thy brawls thou hast disturb'd our sport.
     To dance our ringlets to the whistling wind,
     Or in the beached margent of the sea,
     By paved fountain or by rushy brook,
     Met we on hill, in dale, forest or mead,
     And never, since the middle summer's spring,
     These are the forgeries of jealousy:

   TITANIA

     With Ariadne and Antiopa?
     And make him with fair AEgle break his faith,
     From Perigenia, whom he ravished?
     Didst thou not lead him through the glimmering night
     Knowing I know thy love to Theseus?
     Glance at my credit with Hippolyta,
     How canst thou thus for shame, Titania,

   OBERON

     To give their bed joy and prosperity.
     To Theseus must be wedded, and you come
     Your buskin'd mistress and your warrior love,
     But that, forsooth, the bouncing Amazon,
     Come from the farthest Steppe of India?
     To amorous Phillida. Why art thou here,
     Playing on pipes of corn and versing love
     And in the shape of Corin sat all day,
     When thou hast stolen away from fairy land,
     Then I must be thy lady: but I know

   TITANIA

     Tarry, rash wanton: am not I thy lord?

   OBERON

     I have forsworn his bed and company.
     What, jealous Oberon! Fairies, skip hence:

   TITANIA

     Ill met by moonlight, proud Titania.

   OBERON

     TITANIA, with hers
     Enter, from one side, OBERON, with his train; from the other,

     And here my mistress. Would that he were gone!

   Fairy

     But, room, fairy! here comes Oberon.
     A merrier hour was never wasted there.
     And waxen in their mirth and neeze and swear
     And then the whole quire hold their hips and laugh,
     And 'tailor' cries, and falls into a cough;
     Then slip I from her bum, down topples she,
     Sometime for three-foot stool mistaketh me;
     The wisest aunt, telling the saddest tale,
     And on her wither'd dewlap pour the ale.
     And when she drinks, against her lips I bob
     In very likeness of a roasted crab,
     And sometime lurk I in a gossip's bowl,
     Neighing in likeness of a filly foal:
     When I a fat and bean-fed horse beguile,
     I jest to Oberon and make him smile
     I am that merry wanderer of the night.
     Thou speak'st aright;

   PUCK

     Are not you he?
     You do their work, and they shall have good luck:
     Those that Hobgoblin call you and sweet Puck,
     Mislead night-wanderers, laughing at their harm?
     And sometime make the drink to bear no barm;
     And bootless make the breathless housewife churn;
     Skim milk, and sometimes labour in the quern
     That frights the maidens of the villagery;
     Call'd Robin Goodfellow: are not you he
     Or else you are that shrewd and knavish sprite
     Either I mistake your shape and making quite,

   Fairy

     Creep into acorn-cups and hide them there.
     But, they do square, that all their elves for fear
     By fountain clear, or spangled starlight sheen,
     And now they never meet in grove or green,
     Crowns him with flowers and makes him all her joy:
     But she perforce withholds the loved boy,
     Knight of his train, to trace the forests wild;
     And jealous Oberon would have the child
     She never had so sweet a changeling;
     A lovely boy, stolen from an Indian king;
     Because that she as her attendant hath
     For Oberon is passing fell and wrath,
     Take heed the queen come not within his sight;
     The king doth keep his revels here to-night:

   PUCK

     Our queen and all our elves come here anon.
     Farewell, thou lob of spirits; I'll be gone:
     And hang a pearl in every cowslip's ear.
     I must go seek some dewdrops here
     In those freckles live their savours:
     Those be rubies, fairy favours,
     In their gold coats spots you see;
     The cowslips tall her pensioners be:
     To dew her orbs upon the green.
     And I serve the fairy queen,
     Swifter than the moon's sphere;
     I do wander everywhere,

     It is the lady that Pyramus must love.

  SCENE II. Athens. QUINCE'S house.

     Exit

     To have his sight thither and back again.
     But herein mean I to enrich my pain,
     If I have thanks, it is a dear expense:
     Pursue her; and for this intelligence
     Then to the wood will he to-morrow night
     I will go tell him of fair Hermia's flight:
     So he dissolved, and showers of oaths did melt.
     And when this hail some heat from Hermia felt,
     He hail'd down oaths that he was only mine;
     For ere Demetrius look'd on Hermia's eyne,
     So the boy Love is perjured every where:
     As waggish boys in game themselves forswear,
     Because in choice he is so oft beguiled.
     And therefore is Love said to be a child,
     Wings and no eyes figure unheedy haste:
     Nor hath Love's mind of any judgement taste;
     And therefore is wing'd Cupid painted blind:
     Love looks not with the eyes, but with the mind;
     Love can transpose to form and dignity:
     Things base and vile, folding no quantity,
     So I, admiring of his qualities:
     And as he errs, doting on Hermia's eyes,
     He will not know what all but he do know:
     But what of that? Demetrius thinks not so;
     Through Athens I am thought as fair as she.
     How happy some o'er other some can be!

   HELENA

     Exit

     As you on him, Demetrius dote on you!
     Helena, adieu:
     Exit HERMIA

     I will, my Hermia.

   LYSANDER

     From lovers' food till morrow deep midnight.
     Keep word, Lysander: we must starve our sight
     And good luck grant thee thy Demetrius!
     Farewell, sweet playfellow: pray thou for us;
     To seek new friends and stranger companies.
     And thence from Athens turn away our eyes,
     There my Lysander and myself shall meet;
     Emptying our bosoms of their counsel sweet,
     Upon faint primrose-beds were wont to lie,
     And in the wood, where often you and I

   HERMIA

     Through Athens' gates have we devised to steal.
     A time that lovers' flights doth still conceal,
     Decking with liquid pearl the bladed grass,
     Her silver visage in the watery glass,
     To-morrow night, when Phoebe doth behold
     Helen, to you our minds we will unfold:

   LYSANDER

     That he hath turn'd a heaven unto a hell!
     O, then, what graces in my love do dwell,
     Seem'd Athens as a paradise to me:
     Before the time I did Lysander see,
     Lysander and myself will fly this place.
     Take comfort: he no more shall see my face;

   HERMIA

     None, but your beauty: would that fault were mine!

   HELENA

     His folly, Helena, is no fault of mine.

   HERMIA

     The more I love, the more he hateth me.

   HELENA

     The more I hate, the more he follows me.

   HERMIA

     O that my prayers could such affection move!

   HELENA

     I give him curses, yet he gives me love.

   HERMIA

     O that your frowns would teach my smiles such skill!

   HELENA

     I frown upon him, yet he loves me still.

   HERMIA

     You sway the motion of Demetrius' heart.
     O, teach me how you look, and with what art
     The rest I'd give to be to you translated.
     Were the world mine, Demetrius being bated,
     My tongue should catch your tongue's sweet melody.
     My ear should catch your voice, my eye your eye,
     Yours would I catch, fair Hermia, ere I go;
     Sickness is catching: O, were favour so,
     When wheat is green, when hawthorn buds appear.
     More tuneable than lark to shepherd's ear,
     Your eyes are lode-stars; and your tongue's sweet air
     Demetrius loves your fair: O happy fair!
     Call you me fair? that fair again unsay.

   HELENA

     God speed fair Helena! whither away?

   HERMIA

     Enter HELENA

     Keep promise, love. Look, here comes Helena.

   LYSANDER

     To-morrow truly will I meet with thee.
     In that same place thou hast appointed me,
     In number more than ever women spoke,
     By all the vows that ever men have broke,
     When the false Troyan under sail was seen,
     And by that fire which burn'd the Carthage queen,
     By that which knitteth souls and prospers loves,
     By the simplicity of Venus' doves,
     By his best arrow with the golden head,
     I swear to thee, by Cupid's strongest bow,
     My good Lysander!

   HERMIA

     There will I stay for thee.
     To do observance to a morn of May,
     Where I did meet thee once with Helena,
     And in the wood, a league without the town,
     Steal forth thy father's house to-morrow night;
     Cannot pursue us. If thou lovest me then,
     And to that place the sharp Athenian law
     There, gentle Hermia, may I marry thee;
     And she respects me as her only son.
     From Athens is her house remote seven leagues;
     Of great revenue, and she hath no child:
     I have a widow aunt, a dowager
     A good persuasion: therefore, hear me, Hermia.

   LYSANDER

     Wishes and tears, poor fancy's followers.
     As due to love as thoughts and dreams and sighs,
     Because it is a customary cross,
     Then let us teach our trial patience,
     It stands as an edict in destiny:
     If then true lovers have been ever cross'd,

   HERMIA

     So quick bright things come to confusion.
     The jaws of darkness do devour it up:
     And ere a man hath power to say 'Behold!'
     That, in a spleen, unfolds both heaven and earth,
     Brief as the lightning in the collied night,
     Swift as a shadow, short as any dream;
     Making it momentany as a sound,
     War, death, or sickness did lay siege to it,
     Or, if there were a sympathy in choice,

   LYSANDER

     O hell! to choose love by another's eyes.

   HERMIA

     Or else it stood upon the choice of friends,--

   LYSANDER

     O spite! too old to be engaged to young.

   HERMIA

     Or else misgraffed in respect of years,--

   LYSANDER

     O cross! too high to be enthrall'd to low.

   HERMIA

     But, either it was different in blood,--
     The course of true love never did run smooth;
     Could ever hear by tale or history,
     Ay me! for aught that I could ever read,

   LYSANDER

     Beteem them from the tempest of my eyes.
     Belike for want of rain, which I could well

   HERMIA

     How chance the roses there do fade so fast?
     How now, my love! why is your cheek so pale?

   LYSANDER

     Exeunt all but LYSANDER and HERMIA

     With duty and desire we follow you.

   EGEUS

     Of something nearly that concerns yourselves.
     Against our nuptial and confer with you
     I must employ you in some business
     Demetrius and Egeus, go along:
     Come, my Hippolyta: what cheer, my love?
     To death, or to a vow of single life.
     Which by no means we may extenuate--
     Or else the law of Athens yields you up--
     To fit your fancies to your father's will;
     For you, fair Hermia, look you arm yourself
     I have some private schooling for you both.
     And come, Egeus; you shall go with me,
     My mind did lose it. But, Demetrius, come;
     But, being over-full of self-affairs,
     And with Demetrius thought to have spoke thereof;
     I must confess that I have heard so much,

   THESEUS

     Upon this spotted and inconstant man.
     Devoutly dotes, dotes in idolatry,
     And won her soul; and she, sweet lady, dotes,
     Made love to Nedar's daughter, Helena,
     Demetrius, I'll avouch it to his head,
     Why should not I then prosecute my right?
     I am beloved of beauteous Hermia:
     And, which is more than all these boasts can be,
     If not with vantage, as Demetrius';
     My fortunes every way as fairly rank'd,
     As well possess'd; my love is more than his;
     I am, my lord, as well derived as he,

   LYSANDER

     I do estate unto Demetrius.
     And she is mine, and all my right of her
     And what is mine my love shall render him.
     Scornful Lysander! true, he hath my love,

   EGEUS

     Let me have Hermia's: do you marry him.
     You have her father's love, Demetrius;

   LYSANDER

     Thy crazed title to my certain right.
     Relent, sweet Hermia: and, Lysander, yield

   DEMETRIUS

     For aye austerity and single life.
     Or on Diana's altar to protest
     Or else to wed Demetrius, as he would;
     For disobedience to your father's will,
     Upon that day either prepare to die
     For everlasting bond of fellowship--
     The sealing-day betwixt my love and me,
     Take time to pause; and, by the nest new moon--

   THESEUS

     My soul consents not to give sovereignty.
     Unto his lordship, whose unwished yoke
     Ere I will my virgin patent up
     So will I grow, so live, so die, my lord,

   HERMIA

     Grows, lives and dies in single blessedness.
     Than that which withering on the virgin thorn
     But earthlier happy is the rose distill'd,
     To undergo such maiden pilgrimage;
     Thrice-blessed they that master so their blood,
     Chanting faint hymns to the cold fruitless moon.
     To live a barren sister all your life,
     For aye to be in shady cloister mew'd,
     You can endure the livery of a nun,
     Whether, if you yield not to your father's choice,
     Know of your youth, examine well your blood,
     Therefore, fair Hermia, question your desires;
     For ever the society of men.
     Either to die the death or to abjure

   THESEUS

     If I refuse to wed Demetrius.
     The worst that may befall me in this case,
     But I beseech your grace that I may know
     In such a presence here to plead my thoughts;
     Nor how it may concern my modesty,
     I know not by what power I am made bold,
     I do entreat your grace to pardon me.

   HERMIA

     Rather your eyes must with his judgment look.

   THESEUS

     I would my father look'd but with my eyes.

   HERMIA

     The other must be held the worthier.
     But in this kind, wanting your father's voice,
     In himself he is;

   THESEUS

     So is Lysander.

   HERMIA

     Demetrius is a worthy gentleman.
     To leave the figure or disfigure it.
     By him imprinted and within his power
     To whom you are but as a form in wax
     One that composed your beauties, yea, and one
     To you your father should be as a god;
     What say you, Hermia? be advised fair maid:

   THESEUS

     Immediately provided in that case.
     Or to her death, according to our law
     Which shall be either to this gentleman
     As she is mine, I may dispose of her:
     I beg the ancient privilege of Athens,
     Consent to marry with Demetrius,
     Be it so she; will not here before your grace
     To stubborn harshness: and, my gracious duke,
     Turn'd her obedience, which is due to me,
     With cunning hast thou filch'd my daughter's heart,
     Of strong prevailment in unharden'd youth:
     Knacks, trifles, nosegays, sweetmeats, messengers
     With bracelets of thy hair, rings, gawds, conceits,
     And stolen the impression of her fantasy
     With feigning voice verses of feigning love,
     Thou hast by moonlight at her window sung,
     And interchanged love-tokens with my child:
     Thou, thou, Lysander, thou hast given her rhymes,
     This man hath bewitch'd the bosom of my child;
     Stand forth, Lysander: and my gracious duke,
     This man hath my consent to marry her.
     Stand forth, Demetrius. My noble lord,
     Against my child, my daughter Hermia.
     Full of vexation come I, with complaint

   EGEUS

     Thanks, good Egeus: what's the news with thee?

   THESEUS

     Happy be Theseus, our renowned duke!

   EGEUS

     Enter EGEUS, HERMIA, LYSANDER, and DEMETRIUS

     With pomp, with triumph and with revelling.
     But I will wed thee in another key,
     And won thy love, doing thee injuries;
     Hippolyta, I woo'd thee with my sword,
     Exit PHILOSTRATE

     The pale companion is not for our pomp.
     Turn melancholy forth to funerals;
     Awake the pert and nimble spirit of mirth;
     Stir up the Athenian youth to merriments;
     Go, Philostrate,

   THESEUS

     Of our solemnities.
     New-bent in heaven, shall behold the night
     And then the moon, like to a silver bow
     Four nights will quickly dream away the time;
     Four days will quickly steep themselves in night;

   HIPPOLYTA

     Long withering out a young man revenue.
     Like to a step-dame or a dowager
     This old moon wanes! she lingers my desires,
     Another moon: but, O, methinks, how slow
     Draws on apace; four happy days bring in
     Now, fair Hippolyta, our nuptial hour

   THESEUS
